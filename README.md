# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

For this project, I created an interactive world map using the following resources:  

-	GeoJSON to retrieve earthquake and tectonic plate data. 
-	VS Code as the text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript. 
-	JavaScript, including the D3 and Leaflet libraries, to create an interactive map. 
- JavaScript to manipulate, parse, and transform data.
-	Chrome Developer Tools to view, inspect, and debug the visualizations.
